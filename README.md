Recycling just got smarter, and Miami-Dade County residents are invited to help make it even better. 

In a groundbreaking partnership between the environmental education nonprofit Dream in Green, we at Florida Community Innovation (FCI) are developing a new mobile app called Recyclepedia to make recycling easier, clearer, and even fun for all ages.

Recycling helps reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and cut down on the amount of waste sent to landfills—making it one of the simplest yet most powerful actions individuals can take for the environment. 

Recycling makes a difference, and if the Miami-Dade community joins the mission, we can build a cleaner, greener future, together.

Recyclepedia will be a free app that helps users identify what items can be recycled, locate local drop-off sites, and build better recycling habits through mini games and interactive features. 

We are receiving up to date recycling information from Miami-Dade County’s Department of Solid Waste Management and other MDC municipalities. 

This project is part of a larger effort to boost recycling rates across the county and reduce landfill waste.
